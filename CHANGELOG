---- Changes since 1.070 ----
Fixed a security hole that could allow an attacker to lock valid users by sending a bogus username or password.
Fixed a bug that stopped user limiting from working when Usermin was run from inetd.
---- Changes since 1.080 ----
Fixed a security hole in the maketemp.pl script, used to create the /tmp/.usermin directory at install time. If an un-trusted user creates this directory before Webmin is installed, he could create in it a symbolic link pointing to a critical file on the system, which would be overwritten when Usermin writes to the link filename (CVE bug CAN-2004-0559).
When PAM is used for authentication, expired passwords are now detected and the user is prompted to select a new password (if this feature is enabled on the Usermin Configuration module).
---- Changes since 1.090 ----
Added support for Solaris 10.
Included several additional translations for various languages and modules.
Added support for config- files that allow a range of OS version numbers, and used this to reduce the number of standard config files.
---- Changes since 1.100 ----
When installing or upgrading Usermin, password timeouts are now enabled by default. This protects against brute-force password guessing attacks.

All subheadings have been reduced in size with using the default MSC theme.
---- Changes since 1.150 ----
Fixed a bug that could allow a remote attack if the option to use full PAM conversations is enabled.
---- Changes since 1.160 ----
Replaced all calls to the crypt() function with new code that will use the Crypt::UnixCrypt Perl modules on systems for with crypt() is broken.
---- Changes since 1.170 ----

Added support for DAV clients.
---- Changes since 1.190 ----
The From: address for feedback emails is now taken from the Read Mail module.
Proxy settings made in Webmin in the Usermin Configuration module are passed on to programs Usermin calls via the http_proxy and ftp_proxy environment variables.

When a large file is uploaded, it is no longer read into memory by miniserv.pl.
Changed the default theme for all installs to the new framed blue theme.

Usermin Version 2.203
---------------------
To setup usermin, simply run the  setup.sh  shell script, which should be
found in the same directory as this README file. This will setup Usermin
to run from that directory.

Usermin can be installed in two different ways :

1) By just running the setup.sh script in the same directory as this README
   file, with no arguments. You will be asked a series of questions such as
   the configuration directory, your operating system and whether to use SSL.
   For questions where a default is shown in square brackets, you can just hit
   enter to accept the default (which is usually correct).

   If the configuration directory you enter is the same as that used by
   a previous install of Usermin, it will be automatically upgraded with all
   configurable settings preserved.

   This will set up Usermin to run directly from this directory. After running
   setup.sh, do not delete the directory as it contains all the scripts and
   programs that will be used by Usermin when it is running. Unlike the second
   installation method, the Usermin scripts do not get copied to another
   location when installing.

2) By running the setup.sh script in this directory, but with a command-line
   argument such as /usr/local/usermin . When a directory like this is provided,
   Usermin's scripts will be copied to the chosen directory and it will be
   configured to run from that location.

   The exact same questions will be asked by setup.sh when it is run with
   a directory argument, and upgrading will work in the same way. If you
   are upgrading an old install, you should enter the same directory argument
   so that the new files overwrite the old in order to save disk space.

   After Usermin has been installed to a specific directory using this method,
   the directory extracted from the tar.gz file can be safely deleted.
